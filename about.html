    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p style="padding: 5px 25% 0px 25%;">
        Hello and welcome to Immersed Meta! A place where you will definitely feel welcomed. Immersed Meta is a community that welcomes everyone; a place that is meant for self-growth, making friends, chatting, gaming, and more! And not only is this a community but we are also one big family.

Along side we also look forward to creating more content for this place such as worlds and unique avatars to help represent Immersed Meta. The server invite can be found in the community tab.
